Root path to the game content : /MOHPC/

Importation process in MOHUE Editor :
=> Must be triggered ONLY for the specified asset being opened in the root path. Must not waste time with the importation the first time an user starts the editor

Importation process in MOHUE (standard game) when 'moh.pak' is NOT detected in the game directory, or is invalid :
=> Must open an instance of the UE Editor pointing to the provided project
==> The UE Editor will then load a specific module (mohueImporter) 
===> 1) The module must import all content
===> 2) The module must automatically dump imported content to disk after reaching 1GB of memory usage, into a specific folder
===> 3) The module must start UnrealPak pointing to the folder containing all assets
===> 3.1) UnrealPak must save the content to 'moh.pak'
===> 3.2) An encryption key must be supplied so that it cannot be shared on the internet. Either use the Volume ID, or HWID?
===> 4) The module must delete the folder containing imported content (to NOT waste disk space)

When 'moh.pak' is detected in the game directory, and is valid :
=> Load it normally using the encryption key (see 3.1 above)
=> Mount it to the root path
